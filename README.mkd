Tyler's DotVim2.0
=================

Now with Javascript support!

My original dotvim project has become incredible shitty and unmanageable.  This project is going to focus on organizing the vimrc, what plugins I *actually* use, and hopefully add some functionality around javascript.

To install
----------
1.) `git clone git://github.com/tylerdavis/dotvim2.0.git ~/.vim`  
2.) Create your ~/.vimrc file and add the line `:source ~/.vim/vimrc`
